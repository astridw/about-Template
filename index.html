			<h1>Astrid Countee</h1>

			<h2>Design Engineer-Anthropologist</h2>
			<h3>Part Designer.  Part Developer.  Always an Anthropologist.</h3><br>

			<p>I'm currently the Director of<a href="http://www.techforjustice.org" target="_blank"> Tech for Justice</a>
				at <a href="http://www.internetbar.org" target="_blank"> Internet Bar</a>
				and a <a href="http://astrid.link" target="_blank"> freelance</a>
				UX Researcher, Analyst and Software Developer.<p>

			<p>I started academic life at Baylor University where I studied Psychology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics
				with plans to become a neurosurgeon. But, I fell in love with social science, changed plans, and went on
				 to the University of Houston where I received a Masters in Anthropology. I did thesis work studying diabetes
			   and had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Chronic-Disease-Willis-Countee/dp/3659809977/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1450937203&sr=8-1&keywords=astrid+countee">
					  my book</a> published in 2015.</p>

			<p>While in graduate school I started to code in my job as a data analyst, and grew to love
				programming and computer science. After progressing into more senior data analyst positions,
				I left to learn how to become a software engineer at <a href="https://theironyard.com"
				target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy.</a>
				<p> Since then, I have worked at large companies, startups and not-for-profit orgs. For me, its about mixing and matching computer and social science and working on projects that serve
					and amplify people and causes.  I am currently attending University of Houston-Victoria for Masters in
					Computer Science and Math. I am also a panelist for the podcast <a href="http://www.greaterthancode.com/" target="_blank"> >code.</a>
